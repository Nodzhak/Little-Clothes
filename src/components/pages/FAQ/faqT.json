        "GOTS-certified organic cotton is the largest source of raw material in our main collection. The conventional production of cotton material has a significant negative impact on the environment and potential negative impact on our health: this is why we will never use conventional cotton in our production. In our Summer 2023 collection, we’ve also used OEKO-TEX   Standard 100 certified linen which means the linen has been tested for harmful substances: the article therefore is harmless for human health."
